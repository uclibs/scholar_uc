# Scholar@UC

Scholar@UC is a digital repository that enables the University of Cincinnati community to share its research and scholarly work with a worldwide audience. Faculty and staff can use Scholar@UC to collect their work in one location and create a durable and citeable record of their papers, presentations, publications, datasets, or other scholarly creations.

Scholar@UC uses Project Hydra's [Hyrax gem](https://github.com/projecthydra-labs/hyrax). The source for UC's Hyrax-based app can be found at https://github.com/uclibs/scholar_uc

The Univeristy of Cincinnati's implementation of Scholar@UC can be found at https://scholar.uc.edu.
