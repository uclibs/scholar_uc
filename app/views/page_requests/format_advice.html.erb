	    File Format Advice
      </h2>

      <p>
        Choosing the right file format for your content is an important consideration when contributing your work to <%=t('sufia.product_name') %>. The future usability of your content will depend on the file format you use. Because of this, we recommend uploading two files for each work: an access file and a preservation file.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Access Files
      </h4>

      <p>
        Access files use common formats, ones that we typically use every day. They often use compression, for easy delivery over the web. Access files are what most people will download when viewing you work. Below are some typical access formats.
      </p>

        It is recommended that you upload an access file at the time you complete your submission.

      <h4>
        Preservation Files
      </h4>

      <p>
        Preservation files use more stable formats that access files, whose formats are more likely to change with technology. They often uncompressed and very large. Preservation formats can be used to create new access files, when new formats emerge. Below are some typical preservation formats.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is recommended that you upload a preservation file after the work submission has been completed. When logged in and viewing the work, near the bottom of your screen you will see a row of buttons that includes:  <span class='fakebutton'>Attach a File</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also recommended that preservation files be set to private access rights, so users will not be confused about which they should download.
